The teaching and research that informs this paper were conducted on the traditional lands of **Ngāti Whātua Ōrākei**, under te Tiriti o Waitangi, at *Waipapa Taumata Rau*, and of the **Anishinaabe**, the **Haudenosaunee** and the **Mississaugas of the Credit**, under the Dish with One Spoon treaty and, more recently, Treaty 13 between the Mississaugas and the British Crown, at the *University of Toronto*. 

Additional teaching and learning experiences at *Southwest University*, China, also informed this work. 

It is being presented here in Ōtākou, where **Ngāi Tahu** has rangatiratanga.

## ELLs are not a monolith

::: columns

::: {.column width="40%"}
![](img/babel.png)
:::

::: {.column width="60%"}

👩🏻🎓 ELL = English Language Learner. You may be familiar with EAL (English as an Additional Language) or ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages). **Multilingual learners** may become a preferred term. 

🈶 The majority of the ELL students I have taught have Chinese backgrounds (University of Toronto, University of Auckland, teaching at Southwest University 西南大学).

💰 This project is funded out of the money related to teaching into our Transnational Education Agreement programme with Southwest University 西南大学.

## Why this matters now

* **Global mobility:** English is the *lingua franca* of academia, but our classrooms are linguistically diverse[^1].
* **Challenge:** Students often pass technical language exams (like IELTS/TOEFL) but struggle with the specific communicative demands of *doing* statistics[^2].
* **Opportunity:** Supporting ELLs isn't just about "fixing" deficits; it's about better teaching for *everyone*.

# Part 1: Teaching practices
*Small changes*

## The power of pausing

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* **Myth:** "If... I... just... speak... slowly... they... will... understand."
    * *Reality:* This distorts natural rhythm and hinders learning[^3].
* **Suggestion:** Speak at a natural pace, but insert **strategic pauses** at grammatical boundaries (commas, periods).
    * **1-3 seconds** is often all it takes[^4].
* Give the "Cognitive Cycle" time to spin: 1.  Hear  $\rightarrow$ Translate $\rightarrow$ Formulate answer $\rightarrow$ Translate[^5].

## Instructions: Double double, less toil and trouble

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* **Challenge**: Spoken instructions vanish into thin air.
    * If a student misses one word, they might miss the whole task.
* **Suggestion:** Provide instructions in **two modes**:
    1.  **Spoken**
    2.  **Written** (slides, handouts, annotation or board)
* **Tip:** Even for simple multiple-choice questions, visually indicate the correct answer (don't just say it).

## Navigating shared languages

* **Translanguaging:** Using one's *entire* linguistic repertoire to make meaning[^6].
* **Tension:**
    * Students may want to discuss concepts in their first/more fluent language (L1).
    * *However*, our assessments are usually in English.
    * *Challenge:* Instructors (even bilingual ones) often lack the *technical* vocab in L1 (e.g., "Heteroscedasticity").
* **Suggestions:**
    * Use shared languages for encouragement.
    * Move to English for **content** to prepare for assessment.
    * Work with your tutors to make sure they have support and guidance.

# Part 2: Assessment
*Design for fairness, not just testing.*

## Context comfort

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* **Challenge:** Real data contexts enhance engagement and learning[^7], but may rely on cultural knowledge (e.g., sports).
* **Risk:** We test cultural knowledge, not statistical ability.
* **Immerse!:**
    * Introduce test/exam contexts in a low-stakes setting first (class, lab, tutorial, untimed assessment).
    * Let students explore the data dictionary *before* the clock starts ticking[^8].

# Part 3: Course design
*Building supportive structures.*

## Communication workshops

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
* **Challenge:** Lexical ambiguity in statistics is hard (e.g., "Random", "Significant", "Confidence")[^9].
* **Suggestion:**
    * Dedicate workshop time to **decoding instructions**.
    * Teach "Hedging" language (e.g., "The data *suggests*..." vs "This *proves*...")[^10].
* **Implementation:** At the University of Toronto, the Faculty English Language Learner support team had funding to train TAs to run communication-focused workshops alongside technical ones.

## Example: "Think-Pair-Share" in action

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
*I used this in a Senior Data Science course in China.*


1.  **Think (1 min):** Silence. Display the question text. Allow processing time.
2.  **Pair (2 min):** Discuss with a neighbor. Low stakes. Test logic in L1 or English.
3.  **Share (2 min):** Use **anonymous** polling software (e.g., PollEverywhere).




*Result:* Engagement went from near-zero to **50-70%**.

## Takeaways

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
You don't need to overhaul your entire approach tomorrow. Start small:

1.  **Pause** more.
2.  **Write down** what you say, especially for activity instructions.
3.  **Immerse** students in a context before testing them with it.

*English Language Learners contribute to the diversity, excellence, and sustainability of our field.*

# Alt text {visibility="uncounted"}

Unless otherwise stated, all images were created with Gemini 2.5. The following slides include text descriptions of the images. All images can be considered decorative.

## Title page {visibility="uncounted"}

An 8-bit style presentation slide with the title "Talk data to me?". Two 8-bit characters, one with black hair and a red shirt on the left, and another with brown hair and a purple shirt on the right, stand on either side of a dark blue and light blue 8-bit wave design. The wave swaps direction between the two in a simple animation, as their mouths open and close. Below the wave, the text reads "Supporting English Language Learners in Statistics and Data Science" followed by a list of names under "Liza Bolton, Ping Huang, Christy Sun, Jingdi Sun with collaborators at the University of Toronto: Nathalie Moon, Samantha-Jo Caetano, J. Sparks, Quin Xie".
